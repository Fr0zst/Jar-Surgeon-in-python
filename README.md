# Jar-Surgeon-in-python


Just try to run it like my other Python files

cd (path to file)

python file.py

and if you have any issues with it, such as missing modules
just do (pip install (missing module)) 

If you have any more issues, just post them in issues



Requirements:
- Python 3.9+
- PySide6 (`pip install PySide6`)
- JDK (javac, javap, jar on PATH)
